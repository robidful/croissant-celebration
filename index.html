    <h1>Croissants: a pleasure for our palate</h1>
    <p>
      They aren't really French!
      <br />
      These delicious pastries are said to have been invented in Vienna,
      Austria. The tale goes that a baker created the crescent-shaped bread to
      celebrate the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, mirroring the crescent moon on
      the Turkish flag.
